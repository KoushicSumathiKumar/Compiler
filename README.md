# Compilers & Computer Architecture Coursework
This repositorie contains my **Compilers & Computer Architecture** module coursework which I took as part of my Computer Science Degree during my second year at **The University of Sussex**.

This project is a **gradle project** containing 2 tasks for this coursework. Task 1 was to implement an **Interpreter** which also included me writing the **grammer** for the language. Task 2 was to implement the **Code generator** using the same grammer I wrote earlier. All of this was done in Java with the use of [**ANTLR**](https://www.antlr.org/).

There were various **test inputs** which would need to pass to prove the functionality of the code.

My final score was 83 out of 100 where all of my test case in Task 1 passed and all of the marks lost in this project was from Task 2 as I lost partial marks with the test cases.
